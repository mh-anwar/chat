Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

<h1>Ra ra Rasputin</h1>
<h1>Lover of the Russian queen</h1>
<h1>There was a cat that really was gone</h1>
<h1>Ra ra Rasputin</h1>
<h1>Russia's greatest love machine</h1>
<h1>It was a shame how he carried on</h1>
